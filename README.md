# merge2dirs
Rust-Iced program to create a merge folder from 2 other folders with pictures.

I converted one function in photoomc04 from using gtk4 to iced. Iced is still being developed and the use of progress bar is very hard to implement.

This calls program winitsize01 to get the smallest monitor size.
